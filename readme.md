# Emilie's WordPress Magazine Project

This WordPress theme has been designed and developed for [Erik Fadiman](http://www.erikfadiman.com)'s Interaction IV class at the [Seattle Central Creative Academy](http://www.seattlecentralcreativeacademy.com). The project lives at http://www.emiliethaler.com/scca/magazine if you'd like to check it out!

The challenge is to produce a digital magazine around user needs and content strategy with a sustainable business model.

**The final deliverables:**
- 3 pages
- 10 posts (based on 3 templates)
- 4 versions of the logo

Pages are permanent, fixed parts of the site. Posts are temporal, or articles (in this case). Pages can include home, 404, and others. Post templates with Advanced Custom Fields plugin allow you to create unique, magazine-style layouts for your articles.
